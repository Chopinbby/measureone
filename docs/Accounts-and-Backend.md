# Accounts and Backend

> **Purpose:** The technical design for optional accounts: signing in, and
> keeping a copy of every piece and the technique library in the account, on
> Supabase. The plain-language case for doing this at all, and the risks it
> has to guard against, is [SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md).
> **Audience:** Anyone building or changing Passes 106–113, and anyone asking
> "where does my data live once I sign in?"
> **Scope:** What was decided, how the account copy works (its shape on the
> server, conflicts, deletes, security, connection settings), known limits of
> the service, and the pass plan. Not the reasoning behind each choice — see
> [Decisions.md](Decisions.md#accounts-and-backend). Not the piece schema
> itself — see [Data-Model.md](Data-Model.md#the-piece-object), which the
> server keeps unchanged.

**Status: designed, not built (Pass 105, 2026-09-27).** No code exists for
any of this yet. The app today saves everything to this browser only. Phase 1
is built in Passes 106–113 — see [Pass plan](#pass-plan).

## Decided

Decided by the user on 2026-09-27. Each item has its own entry, with the
alternative it rules out, in [Decisions.md](Decisions.md#accounts-and-backend).

1. **Supabase:** one managed service for sign-in, the database (Postgres)
   and, later, file storage. Firebase was the alternative
   ([SOW §5.1](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md#51-backend-hosting-approach)).
2. **Sign-in uses Supabase's built-in email-and-password accounts**, not a
   login system of our own
   ([SOW §5.2](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md#52-build-auth-yourself-or-use-the-managed-services-built-in-version)).
   No "sign in with Google" in Phase 1.
3. **Accounts are optional.** Signed out, the app is exactly today's app,
   saving to this browser only. Signing in adds a copy in the account.
4. **New accounts are by invitation only until Phase 3:** open sign-up is
   switched off in the Supabase dashboard, people are invited from there,
   and the app has no "create account" form. (See
   [Open questions](#open-questions): Supabase's built-in email sender
   can't currently deliver those invitations to most people.)
5. **No live multi-device sync in Phase 1**
   ([SOW §5.3](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md#53-is-live-multi-device-sync-required-on-day-one),
   decided earlier).

## Design

Recommended while scoping, and recorded here as the design Phase 1 builds
to. Each item has its own entry, with the alternative it rules out, in
[Decisions.md](Decisions.md#accounts-and-backend).

**A. Local first.** This browser's copy stays the working copy, signed in or
not: the app reads and writes it exactly as today, so it stays instant and
keeps working with no connection. While signed in, changes are also sent to
the account in the background, and the account copy is the durable one.
Ruled out: reading and writing only the server while signed in (every action
would need a connection, and a failed request would lose the change).

**B. Shape on the server.**
- **One row per piece**, holding the whole piece object as JSON, exactly
  what `localStorage` holds today, plus its owner, schema version, a
  revision number, updated-at and deleted-at.
- **One row per account for the technique data.**
- **Everything read back goes through `validateAndMigratePiece` /
  `validateAndMigrateTechnique`** (`lib/storage.js`), the same as a local
  load.

Ruled out: splitting a piece across many tables (sessions, progress and so
on). Much more work, every new piece field (this app adds them often) would
need a database change, and the server never needs to look inside a piece.

**C. Never overwrite silently.** A device remembers the revision it last saw
for each row, and an upload only succeeds if the row is still at that
revision. If another device changed it in between, the upload is refused and
the piece is held as "changed on another device" for the person to settle
with the existing import picker (`diffImportedPiece` / `mergeImportedPiece`,
see [Algorithms.md](Algorithms.md#import-merge)). Nothing is ever decided by
"last save wins".

**D. Deleting a piece marks its row deleted** (deleted-at) instead of erasing
it, so it can't reappear from another device and can be recovered by hand.
Deleting the account erases everything (Pass 113).

**E. Stays on the device, not in the account:** which piece is open
(`activePieceId`), the export-reminder dates, the technique corrupt-copy key,
and view state.

**F. The database itself enforces that an account can read and write only
its own rows** (row-level security), so an app bug can't expose someone
else's data. The app holds only the public key; the secret (`service_role`)
key never goes in the app, the repo or Vercel.

**G. Connection settings** (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`)
live in `.env.local` for local development (never committed) and in Vercel's
environment settings for the live site. When they're missing the app runs
exactly as today with no sign-in offered, so tests and a fresh checkout need
no account.

**H. New records get ids with a random part** (Pass 107); existing ids are
never rewritten.

**I. Sign-in lives in an Account panel on the Settings landing page** and as
a link on the welcome screen (a new device has no sidebar until a piece
exists).

**J. The first upload from a device always asks first** ("Back up the N
pieces on this device to name@example.com?"), so one browser's pieces never
land in the wrong account by surprise.

## Known limits

The design brief listed these and said to check Supabase's current terms
rather than take them from the brief. They were checked against Supabase's
own pages on 2026-09-27. Terms change, so check again before relying on
them (Pass 108 sets up the project).

- **The free tier pauses idle projects.** The brief: Supabase's free tier
  has paused projects after about a week without activity. With the
  local-first design nothing is lost while paused; backups wait until the
  project is resumed from the dashboard.
  *Checked 2026-09-27:* still true. Free projects are paused after a week of
  low activity ([pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing)), and a paused
  project can be restored from the dashboard for up to a year after it was
  paused ([project pausing](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/free-project-pausing)).
- **The built-in email sender is for testing only.** The brief: Supabase's
  built-in email sender is rate-limited and meant for testing; fine for
  invitations and the odd password reset; Phase 3 needs a real email
  provider.
  *Checked 2026-09-27:* the rate limit and testing-only purpose still hold
  (2 messages an hour). But the built-in sender also **refuses to send to
  any address that isn't a member of the Supabase project's own team**:
  anyone else gets an "Email address not authorized" error
  ([custom SMTP](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp)). So it is
  not fine for inviting anyone except the project owner. See
  [Open questions](#open-questions).

## Pass plan

**Phase 0 — finalize the design:** Pass 105 (recording this design in the
docs).

**Phase 1 — accounts and a durable account copy, no live sync**
([SOW §7](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md#7-suggested-phases)):
- **106** Save only what changed.
- **107** Ids that can't collide.
- **108** The Supabase project, tables, security rules and connection.
- **109** Sign in, sign out, invite and reset links.
- **110** First backup, verified by reading it back.
- **111** Keep the backup current after every change, with a quiet status
  line and automatic retry.
- **112** Restore onto a new device.
- **113** Account settings (change email or password, sign out, delete
  account).

Manual export and the export reminder stay throughout Phase 1
([SOW §6](SOW-Accounts-and-Sync.md#6-risks-and-things-that-could-go-wrong),
risk 1).

**Phase 2:** multi-device sync, and what happens offline.

**Phase 3:** open sign-up, privacy policy and terms, a real email provider,
monitoring.

## Where this differs from the SOW

The SOW was written before these choices were made and is kept as written.
Where the two disagree, this doc is the current plan:

- **This browser's copy isn't replaced.** The SOW talks about moving storage
  from `localStorage` to the backend (§1, §4B, §7 Phase 1). The design keeps
  this browser's copy as the working copy and adds the account copy beside
  it (Design A).
- **No API of our own.** The SOW's "API" (§4B) is Supabase's: the app talks
  to Supabase directly with the public key, and the database's own rules
  decide what each account may read and write (Design F).
- **Pieces don't gain an owner field.** The SOW says every stored record
  needs a "which account owns this" field (§2, §4D). In the design, the
  owner is recorded on the server row, beside the piece, and the piece
  object itself is stored unchanged (Design B).
- **No sign-up screen, and no "sign in with Google", in Phase 1** (§4A),
  per Decided 2 and 4.

## Open questions

These are unresolved. Don't treat the absence of a decision as an oversight
to silently fix; surface it instead.

- **How do invited people get their invitation and password-reset emails
  in Phase 1?** Found while checking [Known limits](#known-limits) in Pass
  105. Decided 4 has people invited from the Supabase dashboard, but the
  built-in email sender only delivers to members of the Supabase project's
  own team. The owner's own account works only if it uses the same email
  address as the owner's Supabase login. Anyone else's invitation and
  password-reset emails would fail. Needs a decision before Pass 109 (invite
  and reset links). Options, none chosen:
  - set up a real email provider in Phase 1 instead of Phase 3;
  - create each account by hand in the Supabase dashboard with a starting
    password (no email needed to create it), accepting that the person's
    password-reset emails still won't arrive until Phase 3;
  - add each person to the Supabase project's team, which also gives them
    access to the dashboard (probably not wanted).
